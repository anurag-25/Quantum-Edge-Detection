# Quantum-Edge-Detection
Implementation of a quantum edge detection algorithm based on QPIE image encoding.

The objective of our thesis is essentially to explore the image processing techniques through the lens of quantum computing – its power, developments, limitations and future. Naturally, it has been broken down into three sequential steps which are subsequently presented in our thesis.
- Understanding quantum computing and how is it different from the digital computers. The basics of quantum computing are explored to understand its applications in image processing.
- Exploring how can an image be represented using quantum entities and what are the quantum resources for this.
- Developing a quantum algorithm for edge detection – a very crucial process in classic image processing – using quantum image models.

This is the source code of a quantum edge detection algorithm which uses QPIE Image Encoding. This algorithms has a significant increase in complexity over the classical counterpart.
